\title{Responses to Referees Reports: Webs and quantum skew Howe duality}

\begin{document}

\maketitle 

Thank you very much to the referees for their careful reading of this paper.

Here are the responses to the remarks in the referee report. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Changed the introduction so that one discusses the $q$-deformed version of the story more uniformly. Also added a remark regarding the fact that $q$ can be specialized to any nonzero complex number. 
\item Fixed typo.
\item Clarified what happens to the equations under mirror reflection etc. Also, fixed the calculation in Lemma 2.2.1. Indeed $(k,l,r,s)$ should be $(2,k,k,1)$. The weird signs are a consequence of a very early version of the paper when certain relations had signs. The current calculation is fairly straight forward. 
\item Fixed typo to say ``labelled'' everywhere. 
\item Fixed typo.
\item Fixed typo.

\item Added a reference to the suggested paper regarding this result. NEED could some add this reference (i'm not sure how to use bibtex). I cited it as cite{Do} and the paper is 0305208 on the arXiv.
