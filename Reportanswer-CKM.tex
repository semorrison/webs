\title{Responses to Referee's Report: Webs and quantum skew Howe duality}



\begin{document}



\maketitle 



Thank you very much to the referees for their careful reading of this paper.



Here are the responses to the remarks in the referee report. 



\begin{enumerate}

\item Changed the introduction so that one discusses the $q$-deformed version of the story more uniformly. Also added a remark regarding the fact that $q$ can be specialized to any nonzero complex number. 

\item Fixed typo.

\item Clarified what happens to the equations under mirror reflection etc. Also, fixed the calculation in Lemma 2.2.1. Indeed $(k,l,r,s)$ should be $(2,k,k,1)$. The weird signs are a consequence of a very early version of the paper when certain relations had signs. The current calculation is fairly straight forward. 

\item Fixed typo to say ``labelled'' everywhere. 

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Yes, there were minus signs missing which are now fixed. 

\item Fixed argument. 

\item Fixed typos. 

\item Added proof of this identity.

\item NEED

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item NEED. (I added a missing $x_S$ on the last displayed line.)

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Added the referee's suggested explanation in order to help reader. 

\item Fixed typo.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Added a reference to the suggested paper regarding this result.
\item Fixed typo.

\item Improved the exposition, by proving (5.3) first and then using that to explain why the special case suffices.

\item Fixed typo.

\item Added the second hexagon equations. NEED: Besides changing some singulars to plurals, which I've done, I think no other changes are needed; can someone double check?

\item Fixed typo.

\item Added reference. 

\item Added subscripts.

\item Erased ``that''. 

\item Fixed: ``thus be the hexagon equation\emph{s}''

\item NEED

\item Fixed.
